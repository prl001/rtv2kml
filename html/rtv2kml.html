<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Takes the Excel spreadsheets from the
ACMA Radio and Television Broadcasting Book
(<a href="http://acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_9150">http://acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_9150</a>)
in CSV (Comma Separated Variable) format, and produces placemarks
for all the licensed TV and radio broadcasting stations listed
in the spreadsheets on its standard output.
Standard output would normally be redirected to a file.</p>
<p>At each placemark a simple representation of the tower is drawn,
and the antennas at each site are rtepresented by a horizontal cross.
The orientation of the cross is arbitrary, it does not indicate the
orientation of directional antennas.</p>
<p>The <strong>--towers</strong> option further simplifies the display of the tower to
be a single line drawn fom the ground to 3 metres above the top antenna.</p>
<p>Each placemark has a <em>LookAt</em> attribute that sets the viewpoint to
1km south of the antenna and 20 degrees above it when you doubleclick on
the placemark.</p>
<p>The placemark popup lists the stations broadcasting from the site:</p>
<pre>
    ABC9A Canberra 205.625MHz (9A) 50.0kW (V, OD, h: 177m)</pre>
<p>fields are: callsign/channel (<code>ABC9A</code>), area served (<code>Canberra</code>),
frequency (<code>205.625MHz</code>), channel (<code>9A</code>), power (<code>50.0kW</code>),
polarisation (<code>V</code>), antenna directionality (<code>OD</code>)
and antenna height (<code>177m</code>).</p>
<p>Power is the effective radiated power, in the direction of maximum
radiation for directional antennas. For mixed polarisation, it
is the maximum power for each polariation plane.</p>
<p>Polarisation is <code>V</code> for vertical, <code>H</code> for horizontal and <code>M</code> for mixed.
To recieve horizontal polarisation, the antenna elements should be horizontal
and vertical for vertical polarisation.
In some locations VHF (longer antenna elements) broadcasts are on a
different polarisation from UHF (short antenna elements).</p>
<p>Antennas may be omnidirectional (<code>OD</code>) or directional (<code>D</code>).
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Book does not indicate the
<code>direction(s)</code> of maximum radiated power for directional antennas.</p>
<p>The popup also gives the site name at the bottom of the panel:</p>

<h1><a name="data_preparation">DATA PREPARATION</a></h1>
<p>The data in the Radio and Television Broadcasting Book Excel
spreadsheet must be converted into Excel CSV (Comma Separated Variable)
format to use in this program.</p>
<p>You need only convert those sheets from the Book whose data you are
interested in, for example you may only want to view the DTV (Digital
TV) sheet.</p>
<p>To convert, load the spreadsheet into Excel, click on the tab
for the sheet you want to convert, and then select <code>File&gt;Save As...</code>.
In the file browser, select <code>CSV (Comma Delimited) *.csv</code>
in <code>Save as type:</code>, set the file name, then click <code>Save</code>.</p>
<p>Click <code>OK</code> in the warning box saying thet ``the selected file type
does not support workbooks'', and click <code>Yes</code> in the warning box that says that
the spreadsheet may contain features not supported by the CSV file format.</p>
<p>Repeat this procedure, using different file names,
for each sheet of the spreadsheet you want to convert.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> There is nothing in the TV and DTV CSV files that allows
<em>rtv2kml</em> to distinguish the data of the analog and digital transmitters.
However, if the TV and DTV data is saved into files
whose names contain the strings <code>AnalogTV</code> and <code>DigitalTV</code>
respectively, then the <code>.kml</code> files will hold the
placemarks for analog and digital TV in separte folders
(<code>Analog TV</code> and <code>Digital TV</code>).
For example, you might call the files <code>DigitalTVTransmitters.csv</code>
and <code>AnalogTVTransmitters.csv</code>.
Otherwise, all TV transmitters that can't be recognised from the file name
is placed in a <code>TV</code> folder.</p>

<p>The Radio and Television Broadcasting Book only specifies locations
of transmitters to the nearest second of arc. While that sounds small,
it actually allows for an error of about +-50 metres.</p>
<p>The Abridged Molodenskiy transformation used to transform the
AGD66 latitudes &amp; longitudes of the ACMA data to the WGS84
latitudes and longitudes used by Google Earth adds about
another 10m uncertainty.</p>
<p>The transformation accuracy varies across Australia,
and can be quite inaccurate outside outside the mainland and Tasmania.
The location errors for the Lord Howe Island sites are about 130m.
The Lord Howe Island South site.</p>
<p>AM transmitters are typically not a single transmitter tower,
more usually two towers with a horizontal antenna wire between them
(and consequently horizontal polarisation),
and the antenna wire is about 100-150m long.
The ``tower'' shown by <em>rtv2kml</em> is usually located near the midpoint of the
antenna wire, between its two physical towers.
AM transmitter towers are often much narrower than TV broadcast towers,
and can often be best seen by their shadow.</p>
