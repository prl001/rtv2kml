<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Takes the Excel spreadsheets from the
ACMA Radio and Television Broadcasting Book
(<a href="http://acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_9150">http://acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_9150</a>)
in CSV (Comma Separated Variable) format, and produces placemarks
for all the licensed TV and radio broadcasting stations listed
in the spreadsheets on its standard output.
Standard output would normally be redirected to a file.</p>
<p>At each placemark a simple representation of the tower is drawn,
and the antennas at each site are represented by a horizontal cross.
The orientation of the cross is arbitrary, it does not indicate the
orientation of directional antennas.</p>
<p>The <strong>--towers</strong> option further simplifies the display of the tower to
be a single line drawn from the ground to 3 metres above the top antenna.</p>
<p>Each placemark has a <em>LookAt</em> attribute that sets the viewpoint to
1km south of the antenna and 20 degrees above it when you doubleclick on
the placemark.</p>
<p>The placemark popup lists the stations broadcasting from the site:</p>
<pre>
    ABC9A Canberra 205.625MHz (9A) 50.0kW (V, OD, h: 177m)</pre>
<p>fields are: callsign/channel (<code>ABC9A</code>), area served (<code>Canberra</code>),
frequency (<code>205.625MHz</code>), channel (<code>9A</code>), power (<code>50.0kW</code>),
polarisation (<code>V</code>), antenna directionality (<code>OD</code>)
and antenna height (<code>177m</code>).</p>
<p>Power is the effective radiated power, in the direction of maximum
radiation for directional antennas. For mixed polarisation, it
is the maximum power for each polariation plane.</p>
<p>Polarisation is <code>V</code> for vertical, <code>H</code> for horizontal and <code>M</code> for mixed.
To recieve horizontal polarisation, the antenna elements should be horizontal
and vertical for vertical polarisation.
In some locations VHF (longer antenna elements) broadcasts are on a
different polarisation from UHF (short antenna elements).</p>
<p>Antennas may be omnidirectional (<code>OD</code>) or directional (<code>D</code>).
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Book does not indicate the direction
(or directions)
of maximum radiated power for directional antennas.</p>
<p>The popup also gives the site name at the bottom of the panel:</p>

Click on the icon button next to the Name type-in box to bring up the icon
pallet, and click on the icons to display their URLs.
You can just use the last part of the URL as the icon name, with

<hr />
<h1><a name="data_preparation">DATA PREPARATION</a></h1>
<p>The data in the Radio and Television Broadcasting Book Excel
spreadsheet must be converted into Excel CSV (Comma Separated Variable)
format to use in this program.</p>
<p>You need only convert those sheets from the Book whose data you are
interested in, for example you may only want to use the DTV (Digital
TV) sheet.</p>
<p>To convert, load the spreadsheet into Excel or OpenOffice Calc,
click on the tab for the sheet you want to convert, and then select
<code>File&gt;Save As...</code>.  In the file browser, select <code>CSV (Comma
Delimited) *.csv</code> in <code>Save as type:</code>, set the file name, then click
<code>Save</code>.</p>
<p>Click <code>OK</code> in the warning box saying thet &quot;the selected file type
does not support workbooks&quot;, and click <code>Yes</code> in the warning box that says that
the spreadsheet may contain features not supported by the CSV file format.</p>
<p>Repeat this procedure, using different file names,
for each sheet of the spreadsheet you want to convert.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> There is nothing in the TV, Digital TV and Digital Radio
CSV files that allows
<em>rtv2kml</em> to distinguish the data of the analog and digital TV
or digital Radio transmitters.
However, if the TV, DTV and DR data is saved into files
whose names contain the strings <code>Analog</code> or <code>Digital</code> and <code>TV</code>,
or <code>Digital</code> and <code>Radio</code>,
then the <code>.kml</code> files will hold the
placemarks for analog and digital TV, and digital radio in separate folders
(<code>Analog TV</code>, <code>Digital TV</code> and <code>Digital Radio</code>).
For example, you might call the files something like
<code>Digital_TV_Transmitters.csv</code> or
<code>Radio-Digital.csv</code>.
Otherwise, all TV and Digital Radio transmitters that
can't be recognised from the file name
are placed in a <code>TV</code> folder.</p>

<h1><a name="installing___running_rtv2kml_on_unix_like_systems">INSTALLING &amp; RUNNING RTV2KML ON UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS</a></h1>
<p>This section briefly describes how to use rtv2kml on Unix-like systems,
such as Linux, Mac OSX, Cygwin (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>) or
manufacturer's versions of Unix.</p>
<p>If you're reading this, you've managed to download and unzip
<em>rtv2kml</em>.</p>
<p>You can either simply run <em>rtv2kml</em> from its unzipped directory,
or you can install it in some suitable directory in your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to run it from its unzipped directory, it's simplest
to download and convert the ACMA data in the same directory.</p>
<p>Once you've done that, simply run:</p>
<pre>
    ./rtv2kml *.csv &gt; rtv.kml</pre>
<p>Add in whatever options you'd like.</p>
<p>If you want to install <em>rtv2kml</em>, just run <code>make install</code> in
its unzipped directory. That will install by default in <code>/usr/local</code>,
and it creates a <code>bin</code> subdirectory if one doesn't yet exist there.
You may not have permission to do this as a normal user, so you
may need to use <code>su</code> or <code>sudo</code> to do the installation there.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can install in <code>$HOME/bin</code> (the <code>bin</code> directory
will be created if it doesn't already exist) using</p>
<pre>
    make &quot;PREFIX=$HOME&quot; install</pre>
<p><em>Make</em> will tell you if you need to install <code>Text::CSV::Simple</code>,
and won't proceed until</p>
<p>You can install a pre-compiled version (only available for
MacOS and Cygwin), which doesn't need <code>Text::CSV::Simple</code> to be installed,
by using</p>
<pre>
        make install_bin</pre>
<p>You can set <code>PREFIX</code> as with <code>install</code>.</p>
<p>To uninstall, run <code>make uninstall</code> in the same way that you ran the install.</p>
<p>If <code>Text::CSV::Simple</code> is needed, it can be installed using</p>
<pre>
        cpan C&lt;Text::CSV::Simple&gt;</pre>
<p>There are more details about installation in the <code>README.txt</code> file included
in the <code>.zip</code> package.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="using_the_placemarks_in_google_earth">USING THE PLACEMARKS IN GOOGLE EARTH</a></h1>
<p>Once you've made the <code>.kml</code> file containing the transmitters,
you can run Google Earth and use <code>File&gt;Open...</code>, navigate to
where the <code>.kml</code> file is, and open it.
Move the top level folder containing the transmitter placemarks from
<code>Temporary Places</code> into <code>My Places</code> if you want to keep them in Google Earth
permanently.</p>
<p>You can save a lot of space by zipping the <code>.kml</code> file and making
a <code>.kmz</code> file.</p>
<p>Windows systems:</p>
<pre>
    zip rtv.kmz rtv.kml
    del rtv.kml</pre>
<p>Unix-like systems:</p>
<pre>
    zip rtv.kmz rtv.kml
    rm rtv.kml</pre>
<p>You can make the placemarks file smaller when you build it by only
selecting the states you are interested in (<strong>--<a href="#state">state</a></strong> option) or by
simplifying the drawing of the transmitter tower (<strong>--<a href="#towers">towers</a></strong> option).</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<p>The Radio and Television Broadcasting Book only specifies locations
of transmitters to the nearest second of arc.
While that sounds accurate, it actually allows for an error
of about 50 metres.</p>
<p>The Abridged Molodenskiy transformation used to transform the
AGD66 latitudes &amp; longitudes of the ACMA data to the WGS84
latitudes and longitudes used by Google Earth adds about
another 10m uncertainty.</p>
<p>The transformation accuracy varies across Australia,
and can be more inaccurate outside the mainland and Tasmania.</p>
<p>The location errors for the Lord Howe Island sites are about 130m.
The Lord Howe Island South site is shown <em>in the water</em>
which is unlikely to be correct!
It's not clear how much of the location error is in the coordinate
transformation and the lack of precision in the lat/long, and how much
is actual location inaccuracy.</p>
<p>AM transmitters are typically not a single transmitter tower, they are
more usually two towers with a horizontal antenna wire between them
(and consequently horizontal polarisation),
and the antenna wire is about 100-150m long.
The &quot;tower&quot; shown by <em>rtv2kml</em> is usually located near the midpoint of the
antenna wire, between its two physical towers.
AM transmitter towers are often much narrower than TV broadcast towers,
and can often be best seen by their shadow.</p>
<p>The ACMA issues new broadcaster data every month.
If you want to keep up to date,
you need to download and convert the data every month.</p>
