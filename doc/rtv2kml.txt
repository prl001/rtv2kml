DESCRIPTION

    Takes the Excel spreadsheets from the ACMA Radio and Television
    Broadcasting Book (<http://acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_9150>) in CSV
    (Comma Separated Variable) format, and produces placemarks for all the
    licensed TV and radio broadcasting stations listed in the spreadsheets
    on its standard output. Standard output would normally be redirected to
    a file.

    At each placemark a simple representation of the tower is drawn, and the
    antennas at each site are represented by a horizontal cross. The
    orientation of the cross is arbitrary, it does not indicate the
    orientation of directional antennas.

    The --towers option further simplifies the display of the tower to be a
    single line drawn from the ground to 3 metres above the top antenna.

    Each placemark has a *LookAt* attribute that sets the viewpoint to 1km
    south of the antenna and 20 degrees above it when you doubleclick on the
    placemark.

    The placemark popup lists the stations broadcasting from the site:

        ABC9A Canberra 205.625MHz (9A) 50.0kW (V, OD, h: 177m)

    fields are: callsign/channel ("ABC9A"), area served ("Canberra"),
    frequency ("205.625MHz"), channel ("9A"), power ("50.0kW"), polarisation
    ("V"), antenna directionality ("OD") and antenna height ("177m").

    Power is the effective radiated power, in the direction of maximum
    radiation for directional antennas. For mixed polarisation, it is the
    maximum power for each polariation plane.

    Polarisation is "V" for vertical, "H" for horizontal and "M" for mixed.
    To recieve horizontal polarisation, the antenna elements should be
    horizontal and vertical for vertical polarisation. In some locations VHF
    (longer antenna elements) broadcasts are on a different polarisation
    from UHF (short antenna elements).

    Antennas may be omnidirectional ("OD") or directional ("D"). The Radio
    and Television Broadcasting Book does not indicate the direction (or
    directions) of maximum radiated power for directional antennas.

    The popup also gives the site name at the bottom of the panel:

        Telecom Tower BLACK MOUNTAIN

ARGUMENTS

    *Rtv2kml* takes the following option:

    help
          --help
          -h

        Print a help message and exit.

    towers
          --towers
          -t

        Draw a simpler representation of the towers that results in a
        smaller file (about 50% smaller).

    bytype
          --bytype
          -t

        Split radio and TV services into separate folders at the top level.

    state
          --state=state
          -s state

        Only include transmitters in the given state in the output. *State*
        may be one of ACT, NSW, NT, QLD, SA, TAS, VIC or WA. Case is not
        distinguished. The full state names may also be used; if they have
        spaces they must be quoted (and Western Australia not West
        Australia) but there probably isn't much reason to do that. Repeated
        --state options may be used to include more than one state (e.g.
        --state act --state NSW).

        Using a state specifier to only select the state you are interested
        in can also produce a significantly smaller ".kml" file.

    icon
          --icon=iconname
          -i iconname

        Set the icon to be used on the transmitter placemarks. By default,
        *iconname* is "electronics", which is an icon of a TV set. Another
        distinctive icon, which looks like an old-fashioned oscilloscope
        display, is "earthquake".

        The default yellow pushpin used by Google Earth is "ylw-pushpin".
        Other coloured pushpins have prefixes "blu-", "grn-", "ltblu-",
        "pink-", "purple-" and "red-".

        You can get a pallet of other icons to use by right-clicking on a
        placemark in Google Earth and selecting "Properties". Click on the
        icon button next to the Name type-in box to bring up the icon
        pallet, and click on the icons to display their URLs. You can just
        use the last part of the URL as the icon name, with or without the
        ".png" extension.

        Alternatively, you can use any 64x64 icon you like by giving is
        complete "http:" or "file:" URL as the *iconname*.

PREREQUSITES

    *Google Earth 4.x* (<http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html>)
    installed for viewing the ".kml" file in context.

    *Microsoft Excel* to convert the ACMA spreadsheets to ".csv" format.
    This may also be possible using Open Office
    (<http://www.openoffice.org/>).

    *Perl* scripting language. Installed by default in most Linux
    configurations, installed by default in Mac OS X, but is not installed
    in Windows XP or Vista.

    *Active Perl* is a free *perl* implementation for Windows. It can be
    obtained from <http://www.activestate.com/downloads/>. Simply follow the
    prompts during installation. This will also allow Windows to recognise a
    Perl script when it's run via Command Line.

DATA PREPARATION

    The data in the Radio and Television Broadcasting Book Excel spreadsheet
    must be converted into Excel CSV (Comma Separated Variable) format to
    use in this program.

    You need only convert those sheets from the Book whose data you are
    interested in, for example you may only want to use the DTV (Digital TV)
    sheet.

    To convert, load the spreadsheet into Excel, click on the tab for the
    sheet you want to convert, and then select "File>Save As...". In the
    file browser, select "CSV (Comma Delimited) *.csv" in "Save as type:",
    set the file name, then click "Save".

    Click "OK" in the warning box saying thet "the selected file type does
    not support workbooks", and click "Yes" in the warning box that says
    that the spreadsheet may contain features not supported by the CSV file
    format.

    Repeat this procedure, using different file names, for each sheet of the
    spreadsheet you want to convert.

    NB: There is nothing in the TV and DTV CSV files that allows *rtv2kml*
    to distinguish the data of the analog and digital TV transmitters.
    However, if the TV and DTV data is saved into files whose names contain
    the strings "AnalogTV" and "DigitalTV" respectively, then the ".kml"
    files will hold the placemarks for analog and digital TV in separate
    folders ("Analog TV" and "Digital TV"). For example, you might call the
    files "DigitalTVTransmitters.csv" and "AnalogTVTransmitters.csv".
    Otherwise, all TV transmitters that can't be recognised from the file
    name is placed in a "TV" folder.

RUNNING RTV2KML ON WINDOWS SYSTEMS

    Download
        the *rtv2kml* package from
        <http://www.beyonwizsoftware.net/software-b28/rtv2kml-convert-acma-r
        adio-and-tv-station-data-into-google-earth-placemarks/0/>

    Unzip
        and note the directory location of the files. This is important as
        in order to run a Command Line in Windows, you must point it towards
        the unzipped files. For the sake of ease, putting the files in the
        root directory (i.e. "C:\") will make access easier. Tick the "Use
        Folder Names" option in the "Extract" dialog to keep things tidy.

    Create the ".csv" file(s)
        you want to use from Excel (as above). It is simplest to place
        ".csv" files in same location as unzipped files.

    Open
        the Windows Command Line, found in the 'Start' menu under
        'Accessories'.

    Change to the directory
        to where the files were unzipped. For example, if you unzipped the
        files in the root directory of "C:", "C:\" type

                cd C:\rtv2kml

    To run the script,
        type

                rtv2kml.pl filenameyouselected.csv > filenameyouselected.kml

        If that doesn't work, use

                rtv2kml.pl filenameyouselected.csv > filenameyouselected.kml

        Any options go before the ".csv" filename. For example:

                rtv2kml.pl --towers filenameyouselected.csv > filenameyouselected.kml

        This assumes that the ".csv" files are in the same directory as
        "rtv2kml.pl". If they are somewhere else, you need to specify the
        path to them, and to where the ".kml" file should go.

    It's worked
        if nothing more than a command prompt appears.

    To use the new KML file
        either double click on the KML file in Windows Explorer, or you can
        load it from withing Google Earth as explained below.

INSTALLING & RUNNING RTV2KML ON UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS

    This section briefly describes how to use rtv2kml on Unix-like systems,
    such as Linux, Mac OSX, Cygwin (<http://www.cygwin.com/>) or
    manufacturer's versions of Unix.

    If you're reading this, you've managed to download and unzip *rtv2kml*.

    You can either simply run *rtv2kml* from its unzipped directory, or you
    can install it in some suitable directory in your $PATH.

    If you want to run it from its unzipped directory, it's simplest to
    download and convert the ACMA data in the same directory.

    Once you've done that, simply run:

        ./rtv2kml *.csv > rtv.kml

    Add in whatever options you'd like.

    If you want to install *rtv2kml*, just run "make install" in its unziped
    directory. That will install by default in "/usr/local", and it creates
    a "bin" subdirectory if one doesn't yet exist there. You may not have
    permission to do this as a normal user, so you may need to use "su" or
    "sudo" to do the installation there.

    Alternatively, you can install in "$HOME/bin" (the "bin" directory will
    be created if it doesn't already exist) using

        make "PREFIX=$HOME" install

    To uninstall, run "make uninstall" in the same way that you ran the
    install.

USING THE PLACEMARKS IN GOOGLE EARTH

    Once you've made the ".kml" file containing the transmitters, you can
    run Google Earth and use "File>Open...", navigate to where the ".kml"
    file is, and open it. Move the top level folder containing the
    transmitter placemarks from "Temporary Places" into "My Places" if you
    want to keep them in Google Earth permanently.

    You can save a lot of space by zipping the ".kml" file and making a
    ".kmz" file.

    Windows systems:

        zip rtv.kmz rtv.kml
        del rtv.kml

    Unix-like systems:

        zip rtv.kmz rtv.kml
        rm rtv.kml

BUGS

    The Radio and Television Broadcasting Book only specifies locations of
    transmitters to the nearest second of arc. While that sounds accurate,
    it actually allows for an error of about 50 metres.

    The Abridged Molodenskiy transformation used to transform the AGD66
    latitudes & longitudes of the ACMA data to the WGS84 latitudes and
    longitudes used by Google Earth adds about another 10m uncertainty.

    The transformation accuracy varies across Australia, and can be more
    inaccurate outside the mainland and Tasmania.

    The location errors for the Lord Howe Island sites are about 130m. The
    Lord Howe Island South site is shown *in the water* which is unlikely to
    be correct! It's not clear how much of the location error is in the
    coordinate transformation and the lack of precision in the lat/long, and
    how much is actual location inaccuracy.

    AM transmitters are typically not a single transmitter tower, they are
    more usually two towers with a horizontal antenna wire between them (and
    consequently horizontal polarisation), and the antenna wire is about
    100-150m long. The "tower" shown by *rtv2kml* is usually located near
    the midpoint of the antenna wire, between its two physical towers. AM
    transmitter towers are often much narrower than TV broadcast towers, and
    can often be best seen by their shadow.

    The ACMA issues new broadcaster data every month. If you want to keep up
    to date, you need to download and convert the data every month.
